# Finger-Nail-Detection
# preprocessing
Preprocess the data using different image processing techniques like gray scale, gaussian blur, inverted gaussian blur, correlation matrix etc. 
Make use of padding to convert all the images to same size.
Convert the image list to pixel array as only pixel arrays can be feeded to CNN model.
It then should be normalized in order to avoid data overflow.

# Model Creation
Split the training and testing dataset and create a CNN model.

# Model Training
Train the model using the training dataset for suitable number of epochs

# Model testing
Test the model using the data from test dataset and create the accuracy vs loss graph for the same.
