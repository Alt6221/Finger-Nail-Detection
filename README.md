# Finger-Nail-Detection

# preprocessing
Preprocess the data using different image processing techniques like gray scale, gaussian blur, inverted gaussian blur, correlation matrix etc. 
Make use of padding to convert all the images to same size.
Resize the images of the dataset
Upload the training dataset
Convert the list of images into numpy array as CNN takes only numpy array as input
Split the train dataset 
It then should be normalized in order to avoid data overflow.
# Model Creation
Split the training and testing dataset and create a CNN model.

# Model Training
Train the model using the training dataset for suitable number of epochs

# Model testing
Test the model using the data from test dataset and create the accuracy vs loss graph for the same.
Create the dictionary for prediction
Use the keys of the dictionary to predict the output

# Visulaization using AR
Create a 3D hand model using Blender 
Export the model and import into Unity 
Visit the Vuforia engine and import the image target
Test for the accuracy of the image dataset
Download the files from the Vuforia Engine and import it into Unity
Import the accuracy graph into unity
Import the audio file 
Position all the elements and add all of them to the AR camera
Export the .apk file and test it using the image target
